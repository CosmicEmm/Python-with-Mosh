# in Operator: checks whether certain character(s) occur within a string and returns a boolean

# Arithmetic Operators
print(10 + 3)   # sum
print(10 - 3)   # subtraction
print(10 * 3)   # multiplication
print(10 / 3)   # division (single slash): returns a floating point number
print(10 // 3)  # division (double slash): returns an interger
print(10 % 3)   # modulus: returns the remainder after dividing 10 by 3
print(10 ** 3)  # exponent: computes 10 raised to the power 3

# Augmented Assignment Operator
x = 10     # Case: Increment the value of x by 3

x = x + 3  # Method 1: adds 3 to x and assigns the result back to x
x += 3     # Method 2: the assignment operator (=) gets augmented with the addition operator (+)

x -= 3
x *= 3

# Operator Precedence: the order in which arithmetic operators are applied. Follows DMAS but can be changed via parentheses.
y = 10 + 3 * 2

z = (10 + 3) * 2
print(z) # prints 26

# Comparison Operators: used to compare values

x = 3 < 2   # lesser than
x = 3 <= 2  # lesser than or equal to
x = 3 == 2  # equality operator; not to be confused with assignment operator (=)
x = 3 != 2  # not equality operator

# Logical Operators: used to build complex rules and conditions
# and Operator: when both boolean expressions are True, the overall result will be True
price = 25

print(10 < price < 30)  # alternate simplified version

# or operator: atleast one of the boolean expressions must be True for the overall result to be True
price = 5
print(price > 10 or price < 30) # True because 5 < 30

# not operator: inverses any values you give it
price = 5
